# Configurations
This is a house for as many common configurations as possible that I've had to
write out a dozen times, which fatigues me very quickly in a working day. It's
also a thought experiment that I'm trying where I consolidate as much as
possible into a single directory, then symlink whatever is necessary
automatically. Any global updates are made to this repository, then pulled
externally in whatever project depends on this.

It's a thought experiment because I don't know if this is going to be fruitful,
so I'll be trying this out then documenting my findings here.
